Service Locator
===============

Small implementation of service locator pattern for Unity3D in C#

Based on [Stefano Ricciardi's post](http://stefanoricciardi.com/2009/09/25/service-locator-pattern-in-csharpa-simple-example/).

A Service Locator is a common design pattern that allows decoupling clients of services (described by a public interface) from the concrete class implementing those services. Martin Fowler has a great introduction on the topic in his Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern.
